`Filters.jl` is a library for state estimation using recursive filters.

It provides a common interface and modular infrastructure to implement and compose various 
filtering algorithms such as:

- Kalman Filter (KF) - Fading Memory, Iterated (IKF) and Square-Root (SRKF)
- Information Filter (IF)
- Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)
- Sigma-Point Kalman Filter (SPKF) - UKF and CDKF
- Bootstrap Particle Filter (BPF)
